# March 2020 - DeBuggin'

```
It's a good app, buttons are workin,
The forms are a little bit skewed
But it's a good app, I'm getting back some JSON
Routes work and the templates too

Been a long day, in isolation,
Now an error is running through my code
I'm a bad dev 'cause I can't even see it
I'm a bad dev for breaking my app

And I'm Deee
De Buggin', buggin'
And I'm Deee
De buggin', buggin'

All the conflicts, waiting in my repo,
Merge in to github master branch,
And all my team mates are waiting for the updates
Yeah all my team mates are home with broken code

And I'm Deee
De Buggin', buggin'
And I'm Deee
De buggin', buggin'
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin'

I wanna slide down, into oblivion,
Wanna re-write my entire Front End
I wanna de-bug out all my errors
Oh, I'm gonna de-bug this code for a while

And I'm Deee
De Buggin', buggin'
And I'm Deee
De buggin', buggin'
Then I'm Deee
De buggin', buggin'
Now I'm Deee
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm
Dee buggin', now I'm

# April 2020 - She Don't Use C#

```
D                              C
I know a girl who writes in code
D                                       C
She'll make you models, she'll make you nodes
D                                      C
But she don't use C#,  she don't use Python
G                             A
She don't use JS , to rely on
                D C G
She uses PHP
D C G
PHP x2

I know a guy who likes design
He'll make your website, look real fine
But he don't use CSS,  or even Bootstrap
He's a nested rules, front-end chap
He uses Sassy CSS'
Sassy CSS' 3x

I know a dev who likes DBs
They'll store your info, with a stroke of ease
They're always changing the way it's built
They don't use Postgress, or MySQL
They use MongoDB
MongoDB 3X (edited)

# May 2020 - Every Code Has It's Bug
```
Though we both code silently still, in the dead of the night
Although we both branched off of  master, I feel conflicts deep inside
Was it something I pushed or something I pulled
Did my code not work out right?
Though I tried not to break it, though I tried, I guess that's why they say

Every code has it's bug
Just like every mamma has her hug
Just like every ninja, sings a sad, mad song
Every code has it's bug

I'm running our application, listening on localhost
Hear console say there's error 404, when I try to post
But I wonder did I misspell, a method or a route
And I know if we could Live Share now we could work this out, I guess

Every code has it's bug
Just like every mamma has her hug
Just like every ninja, sings a sad, mad song
Every code has it's bug

Though it's been 4 days now, I still can't run this app,
I'm about to throw my laptop, and go , go take a nap
I know I could've saved our code that night if I maybe had some rest
Then you pointed out that the users routes was missin' an "S"

And now our project magically works and can we can maybe add another framework
But I think its best if I sleep right now, but first finish up this song some how, I guess

Every code has it's bug
Just like every mamma has her hug
Just like every ninja, sings a sad, mad song
Every code has it's bug (edited)

I compile my app only for a moment then I realize.
C   G/B   Am     G             Dm7          Am
All my routes are GET requests when only some should be.

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Bugs in the code, all we are is bugs in the code.

C  G/B  Am    G             Dm7             Am
Same old error, lays before my eyes in my terminal.
C   G/B  Am   G                 Dm7               Am
All we code, crashes on our website when it reloads.

Don't git push, nothing works forever but the master branch.
C  G5      Am  G                  Dm7        Am
We'll code again, getting sleep is something I need to try

D   G        Am    D            G           Am
Bugs in the code, all we are is bugs in the code

Bugs in the code, everything is bugs in the code.

# July 2020 - 100 Bad Commits

```
[Verse 1]
 Remember when we when we made that app?
 I ended up with merge conflicts
 Oh my God, I felt so static, lucky me
 I overwrote the file you coded
 And pushed it up to master branch
 Oh my God, I felt so panick'd, lucky me

[Pre-Chorus]
 Wooooaaaah, when all is going wrong and you're scared as hell
 Wooooaaaah, what you gonna push? How can you tell?
 Maybe a hundred bad commits made a hundred good lessons
 A hundred good lessons make me better at committing

[Chorus]
 A hundred bad commits made a hundred good lessons
 A hundred good lessons make me better at committing
 Yeah, no, I ain't scared of git 
 No, I ain't scared of git no more

[Post-Chorus]
 La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
 La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, da, da
 No, I ain't scared of git
 No, I ain't scared of git no more

[Verse 2]
 Remember when I wrote them routes
 Pushed'em up to github, not testing them out?
 Okay I think I'm freaking out, lucky me
 We had to work a bit more hard
 Only just to get a little bit less far
 We could laugh about it all tomorrow, couldn't we?

[Pre-Chorus]
  

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
 N.C
 Push your code it goes like this
 No, I ain't scared of git
 No, I ain't scared of git

[Chorus]

# August 2020 - Space Crabs and the Dirty Code

```
Space Crabs and the dirty code
Is what I code when I'm alone
Alotta bugs and shoulder shrugs
What I get when I run my code
What I get when I run my code

Thirty warnings in my terminal
Will tell me that I can't proceed
But I think I'm gonna stick it out
Cuz sleeping is for the weak
Cuz sleeping is for the weak

If you could see my post request
It can't be secure at all
If I could just get some JSON back
Won't throw my 'puter 'gainst the wall
Won't throw my 'puter 'gainst the wall

Soft light from the full-moon beams
I want to push it up and go to sleep
But every time that I close my eyes
I'm dreaming in code for weeks
I'm dreaming in code for weeks

I didn't feel so bad when my server slowed
But then I got more RAM
And no one to help test my code
Help test my code

Well any dev with a deployed app
Can help you debug your code
And you know why you code at all
If you're thinking 'bout Linked List nodes
If you're thinking 'bout Linked List nodes
```

# September - Undone

[Spoken Word]
Hey Grads, how we doin' y'all?

It’s been a like 3 months, coding’s so rad! Graduation's my favorite part, don’t ya think?

well hey, do y'all want to graduate?

Aw man, hell brah, this is the best y'all. I’m so glad we’re all back together and stuff. This is great, you know

Hey, did you know about the project presentations after graduation?

Aw man, it’s gonna be the best, I’m so stoked! Take it easy, brah!

[Verse 1]
Git push, git pull, conflicts, dang it
I can git bash I think, it's great!

[Chorus]
If you want to deploy my project
Push to Github, and say a prayer

[Spoken Word]
Hey, Adrien what's up?

Yeah um, are you having some issues with github?

Um, I don't think I have time to help, but,like see if your students are available. Maybe they can help you?

[Verse 2]
Oh no, it broke, it gone, bye-bye (Bye)
I am, I think, I sick, and I die

[Chorus]
If you want to delpoy my project
Push to Github and say a prayer (You gotta say a prayer!)
Oh no there's conflicts, a huge disaster!
I'm crying on the floor, Crying on the floor, I've come undone

[Chorus]
If you want to destroy my project
Push to Github don't tell me (As I walk away!)
Watch me panic I'm de-bugging
Crying on the floor, crying on the floor, I've come undone

[Outro]
(I don't want to destroy my project)
If you want to deploy my project
(Let's be friends and just walk away)
You've got to git push and say a prayer
(Hate to see you lying there in your Superman skivvies)
Watch me unravel I'll soon be naked
(Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone!)
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor, I've come undone!
